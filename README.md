Project Title: DebtEase "Take Control. Build Credit. Secure Your Future." Overview: DebtEase is a smart Debt Management App designed to help individuals improve their CIBIL score by efficiently tracking and managing their financial obligations. Managing debts effectively is crucial for financial stability, yet many people struggle with missed payments, high interest rates, and bounced checks. With DebtEase, users can upload their total debt details, track repayments, receive alerts for bounced checks, and ensure that their financial records remain consistent with official documents. Our mission is to empower users with financial discipline and help them achieve a better credit score effortlessly.

Why This Idea? I came up with DebtEase because I noticed how difficult it is for people to track and manage their debts effectively. Many individuals struggle with: ✔️ Forgetting due dates, leading to late fees and CIBIL score drops. ✔️ Overlooking changes in interest rates and missing opportunities to refinance. ✔️ Dealing with bounced checks, which further impact financial credibility. DebtEase is built to simplify debt management and help users stay on top of their finances, ensuring a stress-free journey towards financial freedom.

Core Features:

Debt Upload & Documentation 📄 Users can upload their total debt details along with necessary documents. The app checks for discrepancies when users try to modify key details like interest rates and alerts them.
Repayment Tracking & Alerts 💰 Users can log their repayments and track due dates. Automatic reminders for upcoming payments help avoid penalties and CIBIL score drops.
Checkbook Monitoring & Bounced Check Alerts 🏦 Tracks checkbook serial numbers, issuance dates, and transaction details. Alerts users if a check bounces, helping them take quick action.
Payment Due Reminders 🛎️ Sends notifications for upcoming EMI, credit card bills, and loan repayments. Helps users avoid missed payments and maintain a healthy financial profile.
EMI Calculator 📊 A built-in calculator helps users estimate monthly loan payments based on amount, interest rate, and tenure. Enables users to plan their repayments better and avoid financial strain.
